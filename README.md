This project contains shared classes and business rules for Comiko.

## Getting Started

This project uses code generation. When you modify models, it is likely that you'll need to regenerate files. To do so, you need to run the `watch.dart` in the `tool/` folder.

```dart
dart tool/watch.dart
```

You can also add a run configuration in your IDE/Editor.
